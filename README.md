> This repository contains the source code for an *anime list* project I made

> **What is an anime list?**
>
>> An anime list is a website where you can add animes (style of Japanese film and television animation) you've watched to your personal list by searching for them in the website's database
>>, you can also search for users to see their personal list (if not private)
>
> In my case, the database is on my computer (localhost) since I don't have a server so the website is not accesible (at least for now)
>
> You can view what it looks like <a href="https://cxentury.github.io/Cxntury.github.io/javaEE.html">here</a> (not a web designer as you can see, but it works well)
